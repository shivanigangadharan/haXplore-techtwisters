Overview
During the process of taking a loan, forgery detection in the official paperwork has been a major concern for many years. Frauds are conducted in various ways, one of them being Forgery of documents at the user’s end or middlemen officials’ end. To avoid this, banks have employed manual and electronic detection of forgery of various documents such as Bank statements, etc. This makes the process manually complicated and difficult to process.

Explain about your project, the vision behind it and how it helps enhance lifestyle, etc.
.In order to eliminate the risk of forging the document by the user or officials, we have come up with the solution named “DigiFinT”. Our approach is to solve the bottleneck problem of data sharing and access in Fintech centre. In the application, the user seeking loan grants permission to the financial information seeker like NBFCs to access the right to user’s private information like bank statements, etc, directly from the user’s bank.
Target Audience: FinTech Firms and Startups, Banks, NBFCs, account holders, Loan providers.
