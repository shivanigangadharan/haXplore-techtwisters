## Overview & Vision
In the current fintech system, the financial data sharing is still done via users/account holders who have to get their bank statements and share it electronically/ or as a hardcopy. In such scenarious, users also end up manipulating bank statements to show their credit eligibilty/ financial stability to fintech firms, especially during loan application process. 

- Due to same reason, several fintech firms have been going through forgery detection process in the official paperwork. To avoid forgery, banks have employed manual and electronic detection of forgery of various documents such as Bank statements, etc. This makes the process manually complicated and difficult to process. Thus, user amintaing and sharing data, and banks and other firms doing forgery detection before further processing is the major bottleneck that we are addressing in our solution.

## Project Overview
.In order to eliminate the risk of forging the document by the user/customers, avoid manual intervention and making data avaialble to loan lending firms, directly from sources,  we have come up with the solution named “DigiFinT”. 

Our approach is to solve the bottleneck problem of data sharing and access in Fintech centre. In the application, the user seeking loan grants permission to the financial information seeker like NBFCs to access the right to user’s private information like bank statements, etc, directly from the user’s bank.
- NBFCs, Banks, other loan lending firms directly asks the customer's bank for their bank statements with data shared with customer's consent, and there's a two-step verification involved to make user's data more secure.


**Target Audience**: FinTech Firms and Startups, Banks, NBFCs, account holders, Loan providers.

**Context and Background**: Digital exchange of the financial data can become the building blocks for new emerging service models, remove inefficiencies in the system and open up new product possibilities. Therefore, regulators have acknowledged that enabling a simplified framework for financial information data exchange has the potential to disrupt innovation in the financial market and may lead to product innovation and better customer service.

**Usage**
1.	Open command-prompt and enter:
 git clone https://github.com/shivanigangadharan/haXplore-techtwisters.git (in a desired directory.)
2.	Enter: cd haXplore-techtwisters
3.	Enter: cd digifin-portal
4.	Run: npm start
5.	The web app will be launched

This web-application has been built using ReactJS on the front end. It requires you to clone or download the repository, following which you will navigate to that folder using command prompt. Next, you run npm start and the app will be launched. 

**Tracks used**
1.	Influence the mass : This application eases the time complexity and the paperwork of the users, banks and NBFCs combined. Furthermore, the technology has a disruptive power and our world has become increasingly interconnected with mobile platform enabling ubiquitous access and broader reach, even penetrating into new markets areas where the formal financial market previously could not reach (enabling financial inclusion for unbanked section of the population). Therefore, the financial data access and technology forces have significant implications on the economic growth and have the potential to bring change in consumer services, may fuel financial product innovation and positively impact our lives. 
2.    Revolutionize the Smart World :  Digital exchange of the financial data can become the building blocks for new emerging service models, remove inefficiencies in the system and open up new product possibilities. Therefore, regulators have acknowledged that enabling a simplified framework for financial information data exchange has the potential to disrupt innovation in the financial market and may lead to product innovation and better customer service.
